This requires the open source macro program Automato https://www.dashingstrike.com/Automato/

Add a new folder to the \games folder in the Automato directory. KOA is a good example to use, but you can name it anything you want.

Extract/Add the images, scripts and sound folder to this KOA (or whatever) folder you've created.

Start Automato and click on the KOA (or whatever) folder.
